# Pac-man AI Projects
Pacman AI Projects
This repository contains a series of projects developed for UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. These projects use Pac-Man as a platform to explore and implement foundational AI techniques, such as search algorithms, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. While Pac-Man serves as the test environment, the focus is on real-world AI concepts applicable to areas like natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

# Key Projects:
Project 0: Python setup and autograder tutorial.

Project 1: Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms to solve Pac-Man navigation problems.

Project 2: Model Pac-Man as an adversarial and stochastic search problem using Minimax and Expectimax.

Project 3: Utilize logical inference in boolean representations of the Pac-Man world for planning and localization.

Project 4: Use probabilistic inference with Bayes Nets and Hidden Markov Models to track ghosts.

Project 5: Implement machine learning models like perceptrons and neural networks for tasks like digit classification.

Project 6: Apply reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning to help agents learn optimal strategies.

These projects are written in Python 3.6+ and designed for ease of use with clear instructions and visualized results. Minimal external dependencies ensure streamlined setup and focus on core AI concepts.
